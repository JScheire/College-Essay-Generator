I sat on the grainy wood floor of the art studio, dog-earing pages of Van Gogh’s early charcoal sketches of poor, working men. With few lines and simple shape, he was able to convey an entire existence. With sweeping and curved strokes, he created cypress trees in motion, swaying back and forth. In my own work, I wanted to replicate the masters. I relished the slow and concentrated process of drawing and painting, the mixing and layering of color, the shading underneath a cheekbone or on the crease of an eyelid, all to represent exactly what I saw. 

This past summer I was confronted with a new way of thinking about art. Make a monument to anything. Create an image of a memory you have. At Cowhouse Studios, an intensive summer art program, I was asked to respond to prompts like these. This was exactly what I hadn’t wanted. It didn’t help my shading or brush strokes, it didn’t require intensive focus or precision. These were flimsy, unfinished, temporary exercises…and yet, I ended up with a few memorable images: a tall, thin French kid named Paul standing unassumingly on the base of a stone monument; a man with a mug of coffee for a head, the coffee running into his intestines; an image of a pair of scissors crafted out of tape, water, and holes in the paper. Seeing these works laid out on the floor alongside those of twenty other kids made me question my perspective. 

Through critiques, artist talks, and trips to conceptual art galleries I started to formulate more and more questions about this world of art that seemed to be blossoming before my eyes. Must art have some aesthetically pleasing quality, or can it just be a visual representation of an idea? How much information should be included when artwork is presented, and is that information itself an aspect of the work of art? Is an artwork’s visceral or intellectual effect more important?

My final project combined aspects of my old thinking about literal representation and my new considerations about art. My subjects were rappers who seem to lose their own identity in the brands they wear, transformed into walking billboards. I used watercolor to paint portraits of them, but replaced their heads with an upside down boot in one case, and a toaster in the other. A man with a boot on his head, given no other context, meant nothing to me intellectually but it had visceral appeal. I had been thinking about issues of consumer identity in 1950’s America since I had watched Mad Men, read Death of a Salesman, and studied the period in AP U.S. History the year before. I found myself integrating my new thoughts about art and my interest in history and pop culture into my artwork. Yet I still spent hours on the technical details, working around the negative space of the dots on the rapper’s dark blue shirt, shading the tones of his yellow jacket. 

This past summer, my narrow view regarding the scope of art was busted open and a vast and beautiful world was revealed to me. I had never really had an interest in theater, but a friend took me to Anton Chekov’s Uncle Vanya, prompting me to discuss Chekov’s plays with my dad when I got home. Before I came to Bronx Science, I was solely a “humanities person,” but an inspiring teacher my freshman year sparked a fascination with biology. Clearly, much still remains for me to explore, and to explore more deeply. My education has just begun.whEN I wAS FoUr YEArS oLd, I fell in love. It was not a transient
love-one that stayed by my side during the good times and vanished
during the bad-but rather a love so deep that few would understand.
It was not the love for a person, but the love for a language. It was the
love for Spanish.
Having been born and raised behind the Iron Curtain, in a country
where Western influence was limited and the official and only language
was romanian, I was on my own. Everyone around me, especially my
family, had trouble understanding what could possibly draw me to
such a foreign and, in their opinion, unattractive language. But as they
say, love is blind, and the truth of the matter is that I wasn’t even sure
what it was exactly that made Spanish so fascinating to me. The only
thing I knew was that I absolutely adored hearing its perfectly articulated
phrases, and trying to make sense of its sweet and tender words:
serenades to my innocent ear.
Spanish entered through my door on June 16th, 1994, when a man
from the local cable company came to connect our living room to the
rest of the world. That day, I was introduced to “Acasa,” a romanian
cable network dedicated to broadcasting Spanish language telenovelas
(soap operas) to romanian audiences. As I learned to read, I started associating
the romanian subtitles with the Spanish dialogue, and little
by little, I began understanding the language. For a little girl who had
yet to discover new aspects of her own language, this was quite an accomplishment,
but no one around me felt the same way. My father,
enraged at my apparent “obsession” with the language, scolded me incessantly,
declaring that:
“We are immigrating to the United States, not to Mexico! You should
spend your time learning English instead of watching that nonsense!”
Sadly, my family’s objection was only the first of many hardships
I was bound to encounter. When I was nine, my immigration to the
US forced me to say goodbye to what had become a huge and indispensible
part of me. I needed to hear Spanish, to listen to it daily, and
although Los Angeles could be considered a Spanish speaker’s paradise,
my largely romanian neighborhood allowed for little interaction with
the language. For six years, destiny kept us apart and the feelings that
Spanish had evoked in me soon faded away.
But high school brought about a new era in my life, an era in which
my love for Spanish was revived and greatly amplified. For an hour a
day, life was put on hold and I was able to speak and read Spanish more
actively than ever. After two years of Advanced Placement Spanish, I
not only understood the language to perfection, but spoke it flawlessly
as well.
There are no words that can describe how proud and greatly accomplished
I feel today at my ability to speak Spanish. During a recent
trip to Mexico, I was mistaken more than once for one of the natives.
One man, after seeing my romanian last name, asked me if it was my
husband’s, for undoubtedly, he believed, I was Mexican. given to a
romanian girl, whose family members were oblivious to the language,
and who had learned it on her own despite their objections, this was
the greatest compliment of all. In the United States, Spanish is the second
most spoken language and a great asset for anyone who speaks
it. It is not “nonsense,” as my father had dubbed it, and being able to
prove this to him has made me even prouder for loving Spanish.
My love of Spanish has influenced much of who I am today. The
fight that I led against family objections and immigration to a new land
has allowed me to develop an ambitious and aggressive spirit in the
face of adversity. It has made me stronger, and taught me that I must
always fight with unstoppable perseverance for all that is important to
me. I am determined to use my love and passion for Spanish to make
an impact on the world. Currently, Spanish is the primary language
of 21 nations around the globe, and one of the six official languages
of the Un. I want to be the link that connects these nations to the
United States, and to the 40 million Americans whose native language
is Spanish. I want to use my ability to speak Spanish to learn more
about the people of these nations, both on a professional and personal
level. no matter where the path of life takes me, I wish for Spanish to
always be a part of me.
Through the years, Spanish has evolved into one of my most remarkable
accomplishments. Today, I am prouder than ever of loving
Spanish-of having something that distinguishes me from the rest, something
that makes me unique. It is not often the case for a romanianAmerican
girl living in Los Angeles to exhibit such passion and devotion
towards a language that is foreign to both her native and adoptive
countries. nevertheless, Spanish is a big part of whom I am today, and
an even bigger part of who I will be in the future.
“IT AppEArS ALL YoUr cELLS ArE dEAd.”
Only shock prevented the tears from streaming down my face. My
cells were dead. After being accepted into the competitive Stanford
Institutes of Medicine Summer research Program (SIMr), and spending
approximately 170 hours of the past month manipulating human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs), I was back to square one—with only
one month of my internship remaining. How in the world was I going
to make up for lost time?
As I asked myself the question, I thought back to exactly how I had
spent those 170 hours, working to develop the stem cells which now,
under the microscope, were hollow with the absence of life.
I started my internship a little overwhelmed by the fancy hoods,
automatic pipettes, and high-speed centrifuges. But by the first of the
170 hours, I had familiarized myself with the equipment and begun
my quest to find the function of PrDM1—a gene thought to control
replication in hESCs. First though, I needed to make a growth medium
for the hESCs. I painstakingly measured to the ten millionth of a liter, 
testing the accuracy of each measurement multiple times before finally
dispensing it into the medium solution. After I had plated the hESCs
on my new medium, I waited with bated breath for the results.
To my joy, two days later, my cells were thriving and even outgrowing
their new home. Known for their ability to quickly replicate, it was
logical they would need to be frequently transferred. The difficult part
was that, as part of my experiment to find the purpose of PrDM1, I
had different strains of hESCs (some serving as “control” strains) which
could not be mixed. Transferring hESCs is a process requiring great
concentration and coordination. It took me about three hours the first
time. By the end of the month, though, transferring was second nature
and my cells were doing well—I had inserted a fluorescent protein
into their DnA to verify the hESCs containing the resistant vector were
living, as hypothesized. I had successfully created hundreds of stable
hESC colonies of different strains. Everything seemed to be going so
well . . .
But now was not the time to reminiscence. I snapped out of my
daydream and refocused on the situation at hand.
“Ariela? I know taking the news the first time can be hard, but keep
in mind, you probably didn’t do anything wrong. You know how sensitive
they are . . . this sort of thing is common when working with stem
cells.”
“I know,” I said, smiling genuinely this time, “I’m ready to try
again.”
My project was not completed by the end of the summer, but
through hard work, I was able to replicate parts of the experiment to
produce valuable data. Although the experiment did not go as planned,
I am proud of myself for persevering. As Thomas Edison said, “Our
greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is
always to try just one more time.”ThE TITLE oF ThIS pIcTUrE IS “Abuelo” which means grandfather
in Spanish. At first glance, it seems just a waste of a snapshot. Perhaps
just another struggling photographer trying to pay the rent or who simply
had one more shot left in a roll of film and took a random picture.
It is an 8" by 11" color photograph of a man’s neck, more specifically
the back of his neck. It is quite wrinkled and brown and white hair has
invaded the scalp. At first I questioned why the photographer did not
simply take a picture of his grandfather’s face. A face would allow viewers
to see what the grandfather looks like and tell some kind of story,
certainly more than what the back of his neck could possibly tell.
What I came to realize is that this is no random shot. What this picture
wants is for me to imagine and to create a story. It does not necessarily
wish to be framed but the picture does not want to be overlooked
or neglected. It wants to be given a chance to prove itself as equally
worthy as any other photograph. I do not need the face of the Abuelo
to imagine the story of his life or personality. The back of his neck is
just as important as his face.
After spending some time with this Abuelo I learned that the back
of his neck is not just brown, it is tanned. not just a natural tan, that
some people are born with, but a particular shade of tan that can only
be attained after continuous exposure to the sun. Perhaps this man
does a lot of work outside. The distinguished wrinkles are more than
just lines. In between them there seems to be some kind of dust. I recognize
this dust because it is the kind of dust my father gets when he is
working with joint compound.
After examining a little more closely I noticed the multiple scars
on his scalp which prevent his hair from growing. The tiny hole in his
earlobe reminds me that he was young once and had, like many young
teenage boys, pierced his ear. Around his neck I can see a glimpse of
a brown necklace. This necklace is very familiar to me because I own
one. It is a very thin string with a small rectangular cloth at both ends.
Many Catholics believe that it is something sacred.
In this case this picture is not measured by the thousands of words
it is worth, but it is measured by what I took from it. It should not be 
criticized by what it does not have but should be valued for what it
does have. I have found something in common with this photograph.
All along what this picture wanted from me was to find something familiar.
That familiarity sets this particular picture apart from all other
photographs I have encountered and what has kept it vividly visible
after having come across it years ago. This is exactly what this photograph
longed for: to be found familiar and remembered.mY rEASoNS For wANTING To BE a doctor are very similar to why
most people choose their career path: I want to make things fairer.
People such as social workers are out to help make the world a little
less unjust. It’s not necessarily injustice from other people that I want to
fight as these people do, but injustice from other factors. Many people
who are close to me have been struck down from their future in ways
that it’s impossible for them to recover. My aunt was a great artist and
loving mother before she developed severe schizophrenia. She now
locks herself in her house for weeks at a time and remains isolated
from her family. My friend Eric, who was once in his school’s varsity
basketball league, cannot play his senior season because a car accident
left him nearly paralyzed. Finally, my friend vince’s depression has
stripped him of his will to live, and despite attempts of over a dozen
psychiatrists and medications he still spends most of his days aimlessly
lying in bed. While I try very hard to cheer him up by talking to and
entertaining him I am deeply concerned about his future. This trend is
something that I’m seeing almost everywhere. More and more people
are becoming depressed and hopeless, and I want to be able to put life
and happiness back into them.
not only do I see these injustices in my life, when I’m volunteering
at my local hospital my desire to help become even more emboldened
by the people I meet. A new grandmother I met recently had
her spine shattered when she fell from a ladder back onto a table. As I
talked to her, I remembered how many times I’ve seen pictures of my
science competitions and honors, including 2nd Place in Medicine
and Health at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair and
become the Top Florida Presenter at the national Junior Science and
Humanities Symposium. My computer-aided designs were published
in Biomaterials Forum and the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular
Surgery.
This remarkable experience inspired me to perform many additional
research projects and I consider it a turning point in my life. It has
increased my passion for research and my determination to be a physician
and work on devices or pharmaceuticals that improve people’s
quality of life. I have also become more confident in my research efforts
and am able to contact any researcher to pursue a position in
their laboratory. I have realized that there are many opportunities for
students like myself to contribute to labs and brainstorm solutions for
current problems.
grandmother lifting me and my cousins and caring for us, and became
overcome with emotion. While I don’t believe her ability to care for her
grandchildren will be destroyed, I know that she won’t have the same
opportunities as other grandparents and the inequality of the situation
makes me extremely upset. I want nothing more than to give back her
ability to walk and lift her grandkids. I believe being a doctor can allow
me to bring this closer.hE’S IN mY ArmS, ThE NEwEST addition to the family. I’m too overwhelmed.
“That’s why I wanted you to go to Bishop Loughlin,” she
says, preparing baby bottles. “But ma, I chose Tech because I wanted to
be challenged.” “Well, you’re going to have to deal with it,” she replies,
adding, “Your aunt watched you when she was in high school.” “But
ma, there are three of them. It’s hard!”
returning home from a summer program that cemented intellectual
and social independence to find a new baby was not exactly thrilling.
Add him to the toddler and seven year old sister I have and there’s no
wonder why I sing songs from Blue’s Clues and The Backyardigans
instead of sane seventeen year old activities. It’s never been simple; as
a female and the oldest, I’m to significantly rear the children and clean
up the shabby apartment before an ounce of pseudo freedom reaches
my hands. If I can manage to get my toddler brother onto the city bus
and take him home from day care without snot on my shoulder, and if I
can manage to take off his coat and sneakers without demonic screaming
for no apparent reason, then it’s a good day. Only, waking up at
three in the morning to work, the only free time I have, is not my cup
of Starbucks.
We were already different at age fourteen. She gave birth to me and
went to an alternative high school; I established closeness with new
friends in a competitive high school. She and my then present father
were taking care of me; I was studying the environmental effects on
the onset of schizophrenia. She took her daughter to preschool, and
I vowed to never let anything get in the way of my academics. Even
though I’m taking courses that prepare me for a career in the medical
field, a path I would not pursue even at risk of spontaneous combustion
of Earth, there is no excuse for me to fail. After all, my family has a
reputation for failure, and if I don’t push myself, no one else will. When
I think of me not choosing the effortless Bishop Loughlin High School
and traditional fun with friends and preferring the intense courses,
dedication to achievement, and overall feeling of self-worth, I cannot
believe my mother still can’t accept my choice.
One thing I’ve learned growing up in Brooklyn is that disappointment
happens often. The bike I rode to school in the morning wasn’t there 
when I went to get it in the afternoon. That’s Brooklyn. Instead of
seeing movies with friends on weekends, I work hard and attempt to
keep the little kids out of my mom’s hair. That’s Brooklyn. Instead of
going outside to my backyard, I remember I don’t have one, and settle
for the 12’ by 6’ concrete space in front of my house. That’s Brooklyn.
My Brooklyn doesn’t feature flowers of the freshest air or people who
smile and say hi. Instead, there’s what might have been Orbit gum on
the floor among the other thousand wads, a pool of strangely colored
vomit, and the monotonous working class boarding the subway to the
job it will complain about when it returns home.
If there’s anything that Brooklyn has taught me, it’s “just do it.” I owe
it to myself to keep trying, not because I have to, but because I want to
prove to myself that I can. I’ll have to endure the requirements of helping
to raise my siblings and other responsibilities. After the chaos and
traffic and noise have settled, I know I’ve made the right choice, even if
my mother hasn’t. And it’s all worth it.The alarm clock is, to many high school students, a wailing 
monstrosity whose purpose is to torture all who are sleep-deprived.
Those who believe this are misguided, and are simply viewing the situation
from a twisted perspective. For when these imprudent early-risers
blearily rub their eyes each morning, and search in vain for whatever
is making that earsplitting noise, they are, without a doubt, annoyed.
Why?
It isn’t because the only thing they desire is to sleep a few extra
hours, as many would presume. no, these kids are groggy and irritable
because they are waking up to what they think will be another horribly
boring day of school. If one of these foolish Sallys or Joes were,
say, sleeping comfortably on a Saturday morning, I could certainly see
something different happening. A beautiful breakfast of tantalizing vittles—eggs,
hash browns, and the like—would be ready and waiting for
them on their kitchen tables. But the scrumptious delight to outshine
them all would be a slab of bacon, piled proudly for the taking 
would be that wafting, wondrous bacon smell that would draw dear,
sweet Sally abruptly from her slumber—long before an alarm clock has
the chance to pierce the air.
Oh, bacon: what a marvelous, glorious thing! I live for those heartstoppingly
good strips of succulence, so crispy and crunchy, so packed
with perfection. The thought of having a plate of bacon every day, perhaps
every school day, sends me into sheer waves of ecstasy!
To be sure, many others would also wax poetic about this lovely
breakfast food. But precious few would share this same zeal for learning.
I, however, can smugly decree that I do regard both very highly. I
brightly waken every morning to the mellifluous joy that sounds from
my alarm clock, a huge smile plastered on my face, and the yearning
to learn in my heart.
When I board my school bus Monday through Friday, it is still pitch
black outside. Busmates will groan about how even the day has not
yet dragged itself out of bed; I only chuckle through their thirty-minute
rant fest as we chug down the freeway. Opting to be part of a faraway
Magnet school, after all, has its benefits. My peers may still not
look forward to waking up earlier, but when we are all together in
a classroom, we take on the “bacon mentality.” I have the opportunity
to choose from a wealth of diverse classes, and love arriving to
school each day with the prospect of having a new Spanish History
lesson—taught to me in Spanish, for a change. Teachers, driven by
the enthusiasm of their Magnet students, are inspired to create new
classes for advanced students, including those who have completed AP
Spanish Literature and are still eager to learn more, or those who want
to learn about a specific aspect of a subject—we now have a Middle
Eastern History class. not to be outdone, the post-AP exam period
of my English Language class included an intensive literature study,
where we laughed at good ol’ Yossarian in Catch-22, and developed a
strong attachment to Jay gatsby. I’d like to think that The Great Gatsby’s
pursuit of Daisy is not unlike my own pursuit of bacon. I’ve gobbled up
new knowledge rapidly, hankering after it like any elusive bacon strip,
and happily digesting any new bits of information.
But six classes a year are simply not enough to satisfy my hunger
for knowledge. Just as I eat bacon all three meals of the day (when possible),
I attempt to learn all days of the week. rather than make another
trip to some lackluster movie theatre on the weekend, I dedicate my
time to reading another good book, or reviewing Economics with my
friends. But high school is starting to smell like leftovers to me now; I
want fresh, new, crisp learning. I want not to read a textbook written by
a renowned professor: I want to hear him speak directly. I’m ready for
the university, and hunger for all the new opportunities waiting for me!
I’ve finished my breakfast, and now it’s time to get going to school.ThE GIANT BrowN BEAr wAS crEEpING quietly behind the blissfully
pink duck ready to wring his bare paws around her neck and
throw her into a pot of boiling stew.
We turned the page.
While I chuckled at the impracticality of a bear boiling water to eat
a duck, especially a pink duck, I lifted my head to find Matthew tiptoeing
about the room exhibiting the meanest, most ferocious look his
cute face could conjure. All the while, little Monica sat huddled next
to my arm honestly afraid to turn the page and find her favorite pink
creature in a bear’s “tummy.”
It was one of those moments of my hours spent reading with children
at the library when it dawned just how much, as a “grown up,” I
was missing.
I remembered the Thursday when victoria bounded into the reading
room showcasing in her small hands a golden certificate from school. 
“Best reader,” it glistened. A smile came across my face as I looked into
the eyes of the petite 7-year old who just last year had been held back
in first grade because her reading was not up to par.
It was the same smile that had filled my face six months prior, when
victoria joined the reading program and I saw the other volunteers
instantly point at me. Our supervisor had agreed with them, knowing
I would use my patient disposition and friendly way with children to
motivate our new student. I had nodded vigorously, smiling, not only
because I was proud of the confidence they had in me, but because
nothing would make me happier than taking on the challenge of helping
victoria improve her reading.
After spending the first session responding to an unrelenting stream
of questions, I recognized that victoria’s talkative nature and impatience
for answers overshadowed her desire to sit down and read. I
treasured her energy and insatiable curiosity and fueled it with my own
enthusiasm. Yet, for every interest she presented, I took her to scan the
library shelves in search of a related book. I watched her eyes grow
with excitement as I tirelessly helped her press through the stories, a
journey in search of her answers. Some of the books I chose were difficult
for her, but we read through them together, challenging limits
and quenching the thirst for knowledge. In books, I told her time and
again, she would find all she wanted to know.
Taking her certificate in my hands, I couldn’t help but be proud that
part of this glittering piece of paper was likely my doing.
My thoughts were interrupted by victoria’s chant. “I got best reader!”
she exclaimed over and over jumping between feet as her arms waved
from side to side. Without hesitation, I followed. Holding her certificate
up for all to see, I matched my footing with hers as we hopped the
length of the room giggling.
Whether it is victory celebrations or talking in different voices,
whenever I am with these kids, I find myself being pulled into their
childhood world—a world of simplicity, of undying curiosity, and of
pure innocence. It is a world in which if everything is not perfect, it
definitely can be. And with a simple “prayer to god” or “kiss on the
boo-boo” it will be.
 Though I go in each week to be these kids’ teacher, I come out,
having been their student. They have introduced me to a side of me I
never realized existed.
As I enter college, it is not only my intelligence or my accumulated
knowledge, but also the kid in me who will bring success. This child
will jump to try every new activity with an enthusiasm that cannot
fade. She will ask questions of everything she sees, of everything she
hears and of everything she reads. She will dream big and for every
step she stumbles upon towards that dream, she will get right back up
and step again, this time, a little more carefully. And she will do all this,
approach every life hurdle or triumph with a smile- a big contagious
smile.I hAVE ALwAYS BEEN A mATh-ScIENcE girl. I sighed and sulked
through classes on US History and French in eager anticipation of the
formulas and applications I would be learning later in the day. I believe
there are many factors which attribute to my success, two being my
fascination and persistence.
When I was seven I once asked what math was good for and why
I should learn it. The answer I received simply does not do math justice,
“One day when you’re in line at the grocery store the cashier will
give you too little change and you’ll be glad you learned this.” now
in calculus I see the application of all these once foreign symbols, formulas,
and letters. I am often amazed by the calculations I am able to
do using the cumulative information acquired from nearly 12 years of
education, such as how to maximize the volume of a box given a certain
surface area. Math is not just plug and chug as many view it but
it requires creativity and thinking out of the box to solve the problems
encountered in the real world. Beauty lies in its simplicity and in the
fact that proofs and observations are what brought the golden rectangle
from ancient greece, Pascal’s triangle, and the Pythagorean Theorem as
well as a host of other theorems, equations, and postulates. Math has
made the impossible possible and the once long and tedious, simple
and quick. The genius of it is amazing as well as the fact that any person
is capable of applying and discovering it. I draw graphs and try to
make shapes from functions for fun, count to 10 to calm down, and
save money at the store, too. For all of these reasons and many more, I
am fascinated by math.
I wasn’t always good at math, contrary to what students in my classes
might say. When I first showed interest in math in the 5th grade my
parents laughed; middle school was even worse. Incoming 6th graders
were given a test on the second day of school and depending on their
scores were placed into a high or low speed math class. I was put in
the slow speed math and missed a lot of class my first year, as a result
my grade drifted from a B to a C to a C-, then I got help. I knew I liked
math and I didn’t want to do bad in it so I bought books and hired
my older brother to help me. I eventually made it to a B+. Later, in the
summer after my junior year, I took a course that covered nearly a year
of Calculus. I was told that if I decided to take Calculus AB, I would be
bored, so I went for a challenge. My strongest subject began to take up
most of my time. I had to read review books, go online for help, and
stay in during nutrition and lunch for extra instruction. It was hard,
but my dedication paid off and I earned an A. This persistence and
drive also help me excel in math.EVErY SUNdAY morNING, ThE LocAL STArBUcKS plays host to
what my mom likes to call “mother-son bonding time.” This Sunday is
no different. My mom and I sit down with our regular Chai Latte and
Caramel Frappuchino, and absorb the aroma of the coffee beans and
the gentle rays of the winter sun.
“So Alex, what are we going to do for dad’s 50th birthday?” When
my mom asks a question about upcoming plans, she doesn’t expect an
answer; she already has something in mind. Many years ago, my mom
started a family tradition of making gifts personal: poems, songs, skits.
At first I didn’t understand why we were wasting so much time when we
could just buy a gift card from the local mall. But my outlook changed
when I turned twelve. For my birthday, my parents gave me a poster, a
product of their many hours on Photoshop. With long hair, sideburns,
and a slim suit, I had become the fifth member of the Beatles crossing
Abbey road. Every morning when I wake up, this poster opposite my
bed is the first thing I see, and I start off the day with a smile. Since 
then, I have needed little persuasion to start working on the next gift
project. Actually, I even look forward to these times, when my parents
find their inner children, and the trivial worries of life simply whisk
away. My dad, both figuratively and literally, ditches his office suit and
proper manners, and dons a red woman’s wig and high heels to practice
a scene. My mom stops scolding my sister and me, and joins us in our
ruckus, doing the jitterbug and blowing on a harmonica. These are the
moments in my family when there are no children or adults, just four
people who give in to their creative urges.
“How about throwing Dad a party, and making him a movie?” my
mom asks as I use my straw to fish for any remaining coffee at the bottom
of the cup. “Just think of a movie you like and we’ll parody it.”
A big fan of “the-life-is-like-a-box-of-chocolates” theory, I suggest my
favorite movie, Forrest gump. She smiles. “OK, but only if you play
Forrest.”
When we come home, my mom takes down a box, heavy with the
dust of age, scribbled with messy russian lettering. I peer over her
shoulder as she empties onto the living room floor the contents: my
dad’s life story in black and white. Within minutes, I am completely immersed
in the photographs I have never seen before. As I gape at a picture
of a bearded teenager laughing with his friends, I do a double take.
Is this the same clean-shaven man who helped me to prove the theorem
that all right angles are congruent and always tells me to tuck in my
shirt? I shake my head in disbelief as I thumb through some pictures of
my dad and his friends with guitars in the forest singing songs around a
camp fire. My mom explains that the Soviet government didn’t approve
of these songs, so the woods became their only refuge. I am now starting
to understand why my dad, limited in what he could sing or say
as a youth, pushes my sister and me to ask probing questions, survey
news from all sides of the political spectrum, and watch controversial
movies. Looking down at one of the pictures of my dad in the forest, it
just hits me: the movie should be called “Forest guy.”
 With each picture comes its own story, and collectively, they create
a collage of my dad’s past that I had never known. But even more surprises
await me as I watch documentaries about russian leaders in the
20th century. To truly parody Forrest gump, some “great” Communist
leaders must be part of Forest guy’s life, just as Kennedy and nixon
were part of Forrest gump’s. Coming up with bizarre ideas of how
my dad met the Communist leaders is the most entertaining part of
our moviemaking. My stomach throbs with laughter as I conceive the
impossible notion of my dad bullying gorbachev into destroying the
Berlin Wall.
Along with russian history, I also discover part of my family’s: while
discussing the horrors of Stalin’s reign with my mom, I am shocked
to hear that my father was born in exile, and one of his uncles died in
Stalin’s concentration camp for joking about Communists. It’s hard to
believe that someone can be killed for cracking a joke, when cracking
a safe will only get you a few years in jail. Luckily, when I am joking
about Lenin and Stalin in my film, my only worry is crowd response.
It is the day of the party, and as I look around at the apprehensive
crowd, my instincts yell, “run, Alex! run!” Soon, the lights dim, and
my anxiety grows. I am watching the viewers as intensely as they are
watching the screen. As each joke is met with uproarious laughter and
table slapping, my breaths become calmer and my fingers stop shaking.
Twenty-five minutes later, I hear the long awaited ovation. I gaze from
table to table at the sea of smiles, but one face catches my attention. It
is my dad’s, showing complete disbelief that something so grandiose
could be done about him and for him. All these weeks I had been so
focused on the guests’ reactions that I never thought about my dad’s.
Although he is trying hard to contain himself, I see a tear sneak from
the side of his eye. It is the first time I have seen my dad cry.
Yes, life is a box of chocolates. Some are delicious, some too bitter
for your taste. But the best are like the one I picked that day; they seem
like any other chocolate, but when you bite into them, they surprise
you with an unexpected flavor.ThE coLd mId-AUGUST SAN FrANcISco BAY fog was just beginning
to roll in over Piedmont as I snapped the cover shut on Jennings
Burch’s book “They Cage the Animals at night,” the most recent addition
to my “get ready for 7th grade summer reading extravaganza.” It is
a story about a young boy who lives in various orphanages and foster
homes with only his stuffed animal, Doggie, for companionship. My
cousin from Connecticut had told me that it was a fabulous book, but
little did I know how it would touch my life and the lives of others.
As I gazed across my room at the pile of stuffed animals I had been
collecting since I was young, an idea came to me. I would collect stuffed
animals for children like Jennings. First, I contacted local agencies that
support children suffering from abuse and neglect and told them about
my idea. They said that the stuffed animals would be very helpful in
therapy and would certainly lift children’s spirits.
I decided to call my project “Cuddle Buddies.” now I actually had
to come up with the “buddies”! I wrote articles for the local and school
newspapers, telling Jennings’ story and asking for donations of stuffed
animals. My phone rang off the hook; schools, families, local businesses
and toy manufacturers all wanted to help. Much to my delight this
project took the Bay Area by storm. By the second week my living room
looked like a zoo with animals tucked in every corner and on top of
each chair. Every time my mom and I made deliveries to the agencies,
the kids would be waiting for their Cuddle Buddies with their eyes
down, too shy to look but shaking with excitement.
Six years after its launch, Cuddle Buddies continues to expand.
Each year I solicit from more toy companies and communities. now
over 25,000 stuffed animals have been donated to agencies in the Bay
Area and Connecticut, emergency units, two orphanages in Africa
and one in germany. At the Saidia Children’s Home in Kenya, Simon,
a seven year old, whose parents died from AIDS, couldn’t sleep at
night. When the Cuddle Buddies were laid out for him to choose
from, Simon selected a grey koala bear and soon after was sleeping
through the night. My heart ached when I learned that a young girl
in Oakland had stopped cutting herself so she could get the big black 
dog that she wanted so badly. I never dreamed that Cuddle Buddies
would be used in these ways.
Knowing that I would be going on to college and that others my
age could do what I have done, I decided to expand Cuddle Buddies.
To spread the word beyond the Bay Area I designed a website, www.
cuddlebuddies.net, and contacted newspapers and Tv stations across
the nation. The response was overwhelming. I heard from kids, parents,
agencies and even The girls Scouts. I am now helping to establish
two dozen Cuddle Buddies chapters from Utah to north Carolina.
This has been a great experience. I have learned how to follow
through on an idea, how to champion a cause and how to deal with
setbacks. But most importantly, I have learned how easy it is to positively
impact a life and the joy that comes from it. I will go to college
with these lessons in mind and hope to continue my work with Cuddle
Buddies, even as I engage in a whole new set of exciting academic and
nonacademic pursuits.EVErY YEAr, mY chrISTmAS wISh LIST would read, “Dear Santa,
all I want for Christmas is a baby brother.” At age nine, I knew Santa had
to be real because, one day, my mom announced that she was pregnant.
After ten years of being an only child, I could not have anticipated how
much my life would change because of a little brother. I received the
honor of naming him, and I chose Jason. In retrospect, I should have
named my brother “Ivan the Terrible.”
Jason followed me everywhere like an irritating shadow. My grievances
to my mom were countless, especially after Jason drew all over
my bedroom walls and murdered my pet fish, goldie. My mom’s typical
response was, “Well, isn’t this what you’ve always wished for?”
Jason’s mischief reached a new height one morning when I became
the victim of a five year old with scissors. I stared into the bathroom
mirror and dunked my head under cold water to make sure I was not
dreaming. What I saw enraged me! In the middle of the night, Michael
had cut off five inches of my long, black hair from one side of my
head. I stood in horror, and stormed to the kitchen where I found the
rest of my family calmly eating breakfast. I flashed a menacing stare at
my brother, who snickered across the table. “You’re going to pay for
this!” I screamed. Furious beyond words, I could not even begin to
describe my rage. Instead, I ran back to the bathroom and huddled on
the floor.
“What am I going to do?” I was irate and panicked at the same time.
As a freshman in high school, I was very sensitive about my appearance.
I had been hesitant to cut my hair past the “tips to take away the
split-ends” trim, because my hair had been the same length for seven
years. I agonized over the situation and concocted my swift counter-attack.
Instead of chopping off his hair, I found inspiration to appease my
anger in the pages of Teen magazine and considered trendy hairstyles.
My brother was stunned because I did not retaliate. victory was mine.
Because of experiences such as this, I have learned to adapt, to keep
my focus, and to solve problems with little or no resources. I approach
tough situations with objectivity and determination. Like many other
experiences with my brother and at school, I have dealt with difficult 
situations and turned them into positive opportunities for change. I am
flexible with the circumstances given to me, and I strive for the best
outcome. Despite the craziness Santa’s gift brings, Jason’s continuous
surprises provide laughter to my life. As for my hair, I did cut off the
five inches from the other side, and I actually cherished the new look
better. Thanks, Santa.In our house, English is not English. Not in the phonetic sense, like short a is for apple, but rather in the pronunciation – in our house, snake is snack. Words do not roll off our tongues correctly – yet I, who was pulled out of class to meet with language specialists, and my mother from Malaysia, who pronounces film as flim, understand each other perfectly.

In our house, there is no difference between cast and cash, which was why at a church retreat, people made fun of me for “cashing out demons.” I did not realize the glaring difference between the two Englishes until my teacher corrected my pronunciations of hammock, ladle, and siphon. Classmates laughed because I pronounce accept as except, success as sussess. I was in the Creative Writing conservatory, and yet words failed me when I needed them most.

Suddenly, understanding flower is flour wasn’t enough. I rejected the English that had never seemed broken before, a language that had raised me and taught me everything I knew. Everybody else’s parents spoke with accents smarting of Ph.D.s and university teaching positions. So why couldn’t mine?

My mother spread her sunbaked hands and said, “This is where I came from,” spinning a tale with the English she had taught herself.

When my mother moved from her village to a town in Malaysia, she had to learn a brand new language in middle school: English. In a time when humiliation was encouraged, my mother was defenseless against the cruel words spewing from the teacher, who criticized her paper in front of the class. When she began to cry, the class president stood up and said, “That’s enough.”

“Be like that class president,” my mother said with tears in her eyes. The class president took her under her wing and patiently mended my mother’s strands of language. “She stood up for the weak and used her words to fight back.”

We were both crying now. My mother asked me to teach her proper English so old white ladies at Target wouldn’t laugh at her pronunciation. It has not been easy. There is a measure of guilt when I sew her letters together. Long vowels, double consonants — I am still learning myself. Sometimes I let the brokenness slide to spare her pride but perhaps I have hurt her more to spare mine.

As my mother’s vocabulary began to grow, I mended my own English. Through performing poetry in front of 3000 at my school’s Season Finale event, interviewing people from all walks of life, and writing stories for the stage, I stand against ignorance and become a voice for the homeless, the refugees, the ignored. With my words I fight against jeers pelted at an old Asian street performer on a New York subway. My mother’s eyes are reflected in underprivileged ESL children who have so many stories to tell but do not know how. I fill them with words as they take needle and thread to make a tapestry.

In our house, there is beauty in the way we speak to each other. In our house, language is not broken but rather bursting with emotion. We have built a house out of words. There are friendly snakes in the cupboard and snacks in the tank. It is a crooked house. It is a little messy. But this is where we have made our home.ThIS SUmmEr, I wENT To ThE governor’s Honors Program, also
known as gHP, a six-week intensive college-like experience where the
best and brightest students in georgia gather to learn and grow as individuals.
It was the best thing that has ever happened to me. That
is something of a hackneyed phrase; people cheapen the extremes of
language by constantly using superlatives for everyday occurrences,
making it harder and harder to actually describe the few subtle and
transcendent moments of life. In Madame Bovary, Flaubert claims that 
language is but a cracked kettle on which we play music for the bears to
dance, while we dream of making the stars weep. The experiences we
have never fit within the too-close confines of language; but I will try
anyway. The classes that I attended were nothing like the classes that I
would take normally. nowhere else would the teachers encourage sixteen
and seventeen year-olds to look for sexual imagery in Shakespeare,
and then find even more than they did, without the exercise being
sordid instead of literary. I attended classes named anything from Dirty
Words: Clean Thoughts (a class on Profanity; the only course in which
the use of profane or vulgar language was prohibited) to Teenage Female
Angst: Beyond Holden Caulfield to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. All of them
opened my mind to a brand-new way of looking at the world, and processing
information. Thanks to the varying education that I received, I
know that valuable information about life is not only in the “classics,”
but even appears in seemingly mindless and trashy zombie films.
While I learned a lot in the classrooms of gHP, I feel that most of
my growth occurred outside of the classroom. I met the sort of people
who will change the world, who will go forth into the world and, without
making a big name, will do the things that make the world a better
place. My best friends there were people that I would never have met;
people I would never have known existed; people that I can now not
imagine life without. One was a math major, an excellent athlete in
every sport, and an accomplished singer; the running joke was that the
only thing that he was bad at was failing. The other was a phenomenal
writer, always ready to play an endearing trick on somebody, and the
former’s girl-friend. Both of them were fairly conservative Christians,
and yet totally accepting of me for whom I was, despite any of my
clashes with their beliefs. I did not limit myself though, and made it almost
a mission to find and talk to as many of the people there, because
I was sure that each and every one of them would have an interesting
perspective on things. Once I was walking back from playing Frisbee,
and was stopped to discuss what the ethical framework for life ought
to be; just for fun. The experience that I had there has undeniably
changed me forever.“hErITAGE” IS ThE FIrST word IN my family dictionary, a noun
and adverb, for who we are and how we live. My parents taught me that
my heritage defines my identity. Through honorific speech towards my
elders and adherence to traditional values, I accepted Korean customs
as part of the duality that defines my life in America.
Yet, a turbulent disunity stormed under that surface of peaceful coexistence.
Though I outwardly represented the model Korean-American
son, I loathed fitting this stereotypical mold. My shell was so well-constructed,
however, that others mistook me for a successful immigrant. I
felt as if I were ripped from the very fabric of my American birthplace,
and plunged into a vacuum between my ancestral home and the world
I lived in. I felt that my heritage was a short anchor against the relentlessly
rising tide: I had to break free—or go under.
While struggling with this chain, however, I came to appreciate what
my heritage offered. As a martial arts instructor, I supported students in
building discipline and character. As a bilingual tutor, I helped immigrant
children adapt to life in America. Soon, I realized that my heritage
was an instrument for harmonizing personal development with service
to others.
When I was selected to serve in the HOBY World Leadership
Congress, my family’s financial circumstances did not cover the $1,350
required fee. By infusing my American entrepreneurial energy with
Asian medicine, I covered the cost by selling herbal products at my
martial arts studio. Though the novelty of my venture brought me to the
verge of bankruptcy, I persisted. By researching products, competitors
and clientele, I streamlined my inventory to best serve my customers.
Eventually, I created a business aimed at offering others a healthy
lifestyle. Sweaty students gulped green tea and chocolate-flavored
snacks, dropping dollars for the cause that lay within my cardboard
cashbox. Supported by outside donations, I became greater L.A.’s ambassador
in Washington D.C. Infused with new inspiration, I returned
with a project grant to spread the martial arts lifestyle of discipline,
confidence, and respect.
As my heritage anchored itself to the bedrock of my battles, I integrated
Korean tradition with my American identity. Fusing service
with civic duty, I entered the L.A. County Sheriff’s Explorer Academy.
Through the grueling training, I learned to work as part of a team.
Appointed as Drill Instructor a year later, I took command of training
the older recruits. Through a relationship of mutual respect, I prepared
my platoon to dutifully serve the community. Leading this racially
mixed group, I empathized beyond the duality of my own identity. I
soon discovered that my heritage must transcend my personal struggles
to truly embrace diversity.
Heritage is not a mere ethnic label—it is the honor and humanity
that I am inspired to uphold. Today, I am grateful to my parents for
endowing me with a spirit of dedication and determination. They bestowed
a philosophy that speaks through my actions. This inheritance
forms the base of my integrity as an individual, and defines my dedication
to strengthening the society that I live in.ThE GrEATEST JoY oF mUSIc IS to share it with others. Unfortunately,
the pleasure of performing is often forgotten when players become
more concerned with the technicalities and notes. I also once thought
that I knew all the important keys to successful piano playing: practice,
technique, dedication, and a love for what I do. Focused on the details,
I lost sight of my audience.
During my sophomore year, my friend invited me to join “Music
from the Heart,” a group that showcased its musical talents to senior
citizens. Although I accepted the invitation to support her, I began to
regret my choice as the first performance approached. not knowing
how the seniors would respond to my performance, especially when
I made a mistake, performing before the seniors became a terrifying
thought.
Although my first performance went smoothly, it was hard to know
whether the seniors enjoyed the pieces or the performance. While the
group performed, the seniors would talk to each other, pausing to clap 
at the end of each piece. Trying to impress the audience, I eventually
grew accustomed to preparing a showy piece as the monthly performance
approached.
So used to this monthly routine, I doubted that this performance
would be different from the previous ones when I was ready to perform
my favorite piece one summer day. While waiting for my turn, I glanced
around the room, noting with some uneasiness the growing number of
seniors gathered around the piano. Amidst the crowd of chattering seniors,
one woman’s rapt attention to the performance caught my interest.
She greeted each performer with a wide toothy smile and made a
small comment about the composition. Uncertain of her expectations,
I watched for her reaction when I rose to introduce my piece, “Clair de
Lune” by Claude Debussy.
“Ooh, I love that song,” was all she said in response.
A smile crossed my face when I discovered that she shared my enthusiasm
for the composition. To demonstrate to her how much I enjoyed
the song, I played my best to convey what made this moonlight
song so special to me. My minor concerns on technicalities slowly dissipated
as the song progressed. All that mattered then was playing the
song I loved as well as I could. For the first time, I felt contented with
my performance, undisturbed by mistakes.
The performance was far from perfect. However, none of the seniors
commented that the rhythm was too slow or the notes were wrong
like the audition judges would normally do. Although they still chattered
softly during the performance, they all smiled and clapped. A
few of them would say that the song was lovely. They appreciated my
efforts to entertain them and eagerly asked the group to return soon.
Just the delighted smile on the woman’s face made the performance
worthwhile.
It was the seniors’ appreciation for what I did that brought them
back to the piano each month, and my love for what I did that drew
me to it. The monthly performance was not just a musical showcase; it
was my chance to give back to the community and to help enrich the
seniors’ life. The true joy in my life is not just sharing music, but devoting
myself to community services as a volunteer.SINcE I hAVE ALwAYS BEEN INTErESTEd in science and technology,
I subscribed to many research magazines, including Popular Science
and Scientific American. However, until 10th grade, I never had the opportunity
to contribute to medical research—something that I had always
wanted to do. Then, one day I read an article titled “Print Me a
Pancreas, Please” in Popular Science, which described novel tissue engineering
research involving modification of off-the-shelf inkjet printers
to print out living cells in a “bioink” solution. Having read much about
tissue engineering, I realized this “organ printing” approach could potentially
address problems of traditional tissue engineering methods,
such as the need to precisely place specific cell types in 3D scaffolds.
I was so excited that I came up with a few ideas of my own about advancing
the printer capabilities. I was impelled to contact the researchers
at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and Clemson
University (CU).
I corresponded with the professor at MUSC and visited his lab
multiple times, but realized that the actual printers were kept at CU.
Therefore, I contacted the researchers at CU, who did not reply to
about 50 of my e-mails. not the one to give up easily, I called the
Principal Investigator (PI) and expressed my eagerness to contribute
to the research. After seeing my resumé and computer-aided designs
(“roadmap to Organ Printing”), he invited me to meet him at his lab on
October 18th, which conflicted with my school’s Homecoming dance.
To my friends’ bewilderment I made the “unpopular” decision to miss
the dance. They could not understand why I preferred driving 26 hours
to meet a researcher and miss all the fun at the once-a-year dance. To
me, this was clearly the right choice. I was trading a great school experience
to literally get my hands into cutting-edge medical research.
The PI was so impressed with my original CAD designs (“roadmap
to Organ Printing”) and my resume that he invited me to research at his
lab. Over Christmas and other school breaks, I learned many laboratory
techniques, conducted novel research, and independently succeeded
in “printing” the first functional 3D branching tube of smooth muscle
cells (a rudimentary blood vessel). This research helped me win many 
science competitions and honors, including 2nd Place in Medicine
and Health at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair and
become the Top Florida Presenter at the national Junior Science and
Humanities Symposium. My computer-aided designs were published
in Biomaterials Forum and the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular
Surgery.
This remarkable experience inspired me to perform many additional
research projects and I consider it a turning point in my life. It has
increased my passion for research and my determination to be a physician
and work on devices or pharmaceuticals that improve people’s
quality of life. I have also become more confident in my research efforts
and am able to contact any researcher to pursue a position in
their laboratory. I have realized that there are many opportunities for
students like myself to contribute to labs and brainstorm solutions for
current problems.I BELIEVE IN pEopLE. ThIS coNVIcTIoN drives my action and ambitions,
and defines me in a world of cynicism and doubt. I have seen
the power of people and their ability to come together in times of need
and joy and sorrow. I know that ultimately, humans strive for belonging
and community; thus, while loneliness and anger may always be
in existence, so will be togetherness and bliss. My strong faith in humanity
stems from my witnessing of the best in human qualities while
doing the MS150 and during Hurricane Ike, and pushes me to pursue
a career in helping others. Both of these events have allowed me to see
humanity at its best, performing selfless acts of benevolence.
For the past four years, I have participated in the BPMS150 bike
tour from Houston to Austin. This 175 mile ride raises funds for the
national MS Society, which sponsors medical research for multiple sclerosis
and aids the families of its victims. I can say from experience, the
ride is grueling; enormous hills, headwinds, fatigue, and body aches
are prevalent throughout. Yet every year, over thirteen thousand riders
decide to put their minds and bodies through two days of torture so
that they can help those who live with it every day. I have raised, over
four years, more than eight thousand dollars to benefit the MS Society,
and have never regretted any of the painful training or the ride itself.
The view at the starting line is one of the most empowering I have ever 
witnessed: thousands of people, all of them with their hands on their
handle bars, one foot poised on a pedal. All are ready to experience
exhaustion for the benefit of others, like my father. He was diagnosed
with MS when I was four, and is a constant motivator for me. I witnessed
him become blind in one eye, and struggle with a body that refuses
to function normally. I participate in this ride every year for him,
as do thirteen thousand others. The power of people will ultimately
help my father to receive better medical treatment, and maybe even
one day, be cured.
While writing this essay, I was also able to observe and be a part of
amazing human efforts. Hurricane Ike devastated Southeastern Texas,
particularly the Houston and galveston areas. Much of my extended
family lives in galveston, and so was forced to evacuate. Without hesitation,
my parents opened up our home to aunts, uncles, grandparents,
cousins, and pets. This is the environment in which I have always
lived; our home is anyone’s shelter, our food is anyone’s nourishment.
Together, our entire family weathered the storm, and comforted one
another. My aunt’s home received electrical power prior to my home,
and so she eagerly welcomed us to stay with her. Large scale displays
of altruism could be seen in the hundreds of University of Houston
students handing out food and water to those affected by the hurricane.
During times of need, people band together for safety and solace.
Community is instinctual; dismiss the notions of survival of the fittest.
People truly desire closeness with one another.
In the future, I hope to pursue a career in public health. I love
studying science and math, and I would like to use this passion to
benefit large numbers of people. Many go without basic medical treatment,
and this causes a huge discrepancy in quality of life and health in
the population. Even if this problem can never completely be solved,
I want to help remedy this as much as possible. With small deeds and
cooperative effort, humans can accomplish immense good. I know this
because I believe in people, and I have seen them at their finest.“hELLo! whAT’S YoUr NAmE?” “pEN-YUAN hSING.” I see The
Expression, then hear The response: “What?” Starting the first grade in
the US without knowing a single word of English, going back to Taiwan
three years later incapable of recognizing a single Chinese character is
not exactly an ideal circumstance for blending in. For many years, I 
was always the quiet one sitting in the corner, the one who few people
talked to, the one out of the loop. I was the “local alien.”
I opt to join the Earth Science Club during my first year in Lishan
High School, as I always had an interest in astronomy, which happened
to be the focus of that year’s club activities. I didn’t know the weekly
gathering time of our club was also an elective Earth Science course
that students from other high schools could attend. I certainly did not
realize what a big impact this arrangement would have on me.
near the end of the first semester, I was approached by a girl from a
neighboring school who attended this earth science course. She asked
if I wanted to join her on an environmental survey of Taiwan’s Keelung
coast conducted by an organization called Taipei Wetnet. For a moment
I hesitated, I literally had no experience in responding to invitations.
What suddenly came out of my mouth surprised me, “Sure, what
time?”
For the next three years I spent in Taipei Wetnet, I gained not only
a close friend, knowledge about the problems our environment faced,
but perhaps most importantly found a group of people who shared the
same convictions, who are passionate about the same thing, the plight
of our precious planet. A year after being introduced to this organization,
I was its coordinator and presented my first academic paper at an
environmental education conference. I learned that I don’t always have
to be the quiet one in the corner, that I do and can have things to share
with everyone else. I don’t have to fear.
I often think about how I managed to say yes on that fateful day.
Was it just because of a pretty face? Or maybe there has always been a
special part of me that wanted to get out, and she was instrumental in
“flipping the switch.” This eye-opening experience and what I learned
from it is what I desperately want to share with the world.
Perhaps, somewhere out there is another quiet person in the corner
just waiting to be found. A switch waiting to be flipped. You just have
to find it, flip it, and make the world a brighter, warmer place.whEN mY GrANdmoThEr cAmE To VISIT five years ago, she
brought me a 3,000 piece jigsaw puzzle. To most, this would not sound
very exciting—it would be almost as bad as a shirt saying “My grandparents
went to India, and all they bought me was this stupid shirt.”
My reaction to the puzzle was different. I cut open the cardboard box
as soon as I could, and poured the pieces out onto my puzzleboard.
I worked patiently on the puzzle for hours at a time, my excitement
building as more and more of the picture was revealed. I cut down my
sleep time until the image of a picturesque forest was complete. The
puzzle overshadowed all else in my life, if only for that short period of
time.
Working on puzzles has helped me gain focus, determination, and
patience. I have learned to apply these qualities to every task I face,
dealing with the outside world in the same fashion as I would a puzzle.
My love for science stems largely from this; science requires the same
logical and levelheaded approach that a puzzle does, and as evidenced 
by the many puzzles decorating my house, this is an approach which
suits my skills and temperament. This intellectual stimulation, coupled
with a desire to discover more about life’s mysteries, compels me to
pursue a career in scientific research.
This summer, I worked in a cardiology laboratory at UCLA, looking
at proteins associated with HDL to understand how atherosclerosis
can be averted. After some experiments provided questionable results,
I was given the task of confirming that the viruses we were working
with had been packaged and identified correctly. I spent weeks running
DnA gels, looking for specific genes in each virus, but my results were
inconsistent. I was frustrated, but instead of giving up on my assignment,
I was even more determined to find an explanation. I considered
every aspect of the experiment, working backwards until I reached the
source—the primers I had used to amplify the DnA were nonspecific
and ineffective, and thus useless in distinguishing the three genes of
interest to us. Knowing this, I was able to alter my experiment accordingly,
looking at protein content instead of DnA sequences. I finally
showed that two of the three viruses were correct; the third, however,
needed to be repackaged. My work was crucial to the undergraduate
student I was working with, because he was able to redesign his experiment
to account for this third virus.
Working in a lab was an exhilarating experience for me. Even though
I gave up lying on the beach to instead play with viruses and chemicals,
the compulsion to understand these proteins inspired and motivated
me. I am tremendously proud of the piece I contributed to the atherosclerosis
puzzle: a small piece, but integral nonetheless. The sense of
accomplishment I felt because of my work in the UCLA lab was much
the same as that which I felt upon completing the 3,000 piece puzzle
my grandmother gave me. This feeling is one I hope to experience
throughout my life, because the atherosclerosis puzzle is most assuredly
not the last such puzzle I will work on.ThIS pAST SUmmEr I hAd ThE opportunity to participate in a highly
rigorous academic program at MIT called MITES, Minority Introduction
to Engineering and Science. For six and a half weeks I lived with 68
other rising seniors and college undergrads. Though we were all warned
about how hard the program would be, we were all at the top of our
classes and refused to believe it- after all, who did they think we were?
The first day we sat together in a small auditorium, unaware of each
other and of what lay ahead. We were told that our confidence would
be shattered, our minds blown away, and our lives changed forever.
Still somewhat unmoved, we were not afraid.
By the second week of MITES valedictorians, nerds, bookworms,
and techies alike were leaning on each other’s shoulders at two in the
morning crying over problem sets they had imagined only in nightmares.
It is a well known fact that hard times bring friends closer together,
but I would have never expected for these strangers to become
my best friends, my support system, or even my family. The 16 hours
days I was accustomed to at home did not last long. I was getting an
average of four hours of sleep per night, finishing a book per week,
zooming through subjects once foreign to me, and constructing a semiautonomous
robot from drill motors all at the same time.
We were each enrolled in 5 classes, my schedule consisted of
Introductory Physics, Engineering Design, Chemistry, first year
Calculus, and Humanities. In the month and a half we completed a
semester of Physics and Chemistry each, a full year of Calculus, the material
equivalent to a semester in AP literature, and introductory level
engineering. The work was so intense that when I entered school in the 
fall I enrolled in second year Calculus, and maintained the only A in AP
Physics, having no physics experience prior to MITES.
Since this program I have not been satisfied with the regular coursework
given at my school. I am constantly on the lookout for new programs
to enroll in and other teams, clubs, and groups to join. This
academic school year marks the peak of my involvement in educational
opportunities. I have somehow managed to find time for the
Speech and Debate team, ACE mentoring team, swim team, Science
Bowl team, California Honors Society and Scholarship Federation, Play
Production, Jewish Student Union, gEAr-UP Mentoring Program, and
folklorico dancing.
MITES was the most challenging experience of my life. The program
is the single most pivotal point in my academic endeavors to date.
The assistants we had had all gone through the program and agreed
that even in college at Harvard, MIT, Caltech, and Princeton, nothing
came close. The motivation and encouragement I gained from MITES
has fueled my academic pursuits and pushed me to raise the bar.I Trod ThE mUd IN ThE misty spring rain. It was Qing Ming, the
holiday in China when we honored our deceased ancestors. On the
ground of the cemetery, drenched flowers lay in my grandfather’s remembrance.
That morning—a month before my sixth birthday—I
clung tightly to my mother’s sleeves and finally learned why he passed
away.
My grandfather had been a victim of cancer. Because the diagnosis
came too late, all treatment was futile. As my mother whispered this to
me with grief in her eyes, I stomped angrily in the mud. I blamed the
doctors who couldn’t find the tumor in time to save him. That rainy
morning launched my dream to help cure cancer—a common wish,
but one that fueled a life-changing pursuit. Knowing that the best pro-
tection against cancer was to detect it as early as possible, I examined
the widely used methods of detection. I read about mammography and
was astounded to learn that it failed to detect a large percentage of
cases. As I wondered how to make detection more accurate, I heard
about a research internship program at ____ Cancer Center. I jumped
at the opportunity.
There, my mentors encouraged me to investigate cancer’s genetic
causes. I became intrigued by a gene suspected to play a role in the
onset of breast cancer. We examined a process of gene-silencing—
known as methylation—that changed DnA structure while keeping
the sequence itself intact. Through a series of assays, we pinpointed
the methylated sites in the gene sequence that distinguished cancerous
breast cells from healthy cells. These were markers of disease!
The thrill came from knowing the vast clinical applications of the
discovery. Finding such markers is a step toward the individualization
of cancer treatment. genomics-based diagnostics would detect cancer
earlier than traditional procedures. Also, since methylation does not
change the DnA sequence, it is reversible. Therapeutics could target
these sites and minimize harm to healthy tissue.
Personalized cancer diagnostics promise a new dawn, but they are
not yet reality. Many more genes need to be studied before we can fully
comprehend the roots of the disease. Awed by the complexity of cancer,
I realized that my dream was much more intricate than I imagined.
However, my youthful passion in medicine did not dwindle. Instead,
it strengthened and matured into a strategy. As my vague goals shaped
into specific inquiries, my curiosity became insatiable. The joy of uncovering
the unknown affirmed my love for science. My generation will
keep pushing the boundaries of knowledge, and nothing would give
me more fulfillment than continuing to fight in the war on cancer.
I recall that rainy Qing Ming morning when I gazed at my grandfather’s
gravesite. I wish I could tell him about the adventure he inspired.
This war will be arduous, but every little “eureka!” along the way is a
portent of victory.
“roSENcrANTz ANd GUILdENSTErN ArE dEAd” IS an astounding,
intellectually challenging, and humorous concoction. Stoppard
cleverly captures the characters of Hamlet, written by Shakespeare, but
creates somewhat of a comic tragedy. Clearly an oxymoron, but profoundly
effective. The play focuses on the story of Hamlet, but from the
viewpoint of rosencrantz and guildenstern, and it also takes the theories
proposed in Hamlet and presents them in a comic, rather than sullen,
manner. One of the most humorous scenes is when rosencrantz,
or guildenstern, since the distinction is never truly made between
the two, is laying on a table and thinking to himself what it is like
to be “dead in a box.” This scene proves to be hilarious, despite its
deep meaning, and parallels the infamous “To be, or not to be” speech
in Hamlet. Life’s unanswerable questions are constantly being asked
throughout the play, but by inserting these dubious inquiries within
a comedy, Stoppard is able to captivate and preserve his audience’s attention.
In fact, the humor provides the wiring, which connects the 
messages of the play to our own chaotic existences. This brilliant literary
work captures the essence of a tragedy within a comedy, something
only few authors can accomplish. It is able to provide profound, theoretical
ideas that have long been questioned into a comic perspective,
and yet keep its integrity.JULY 22 LAST YEAr wAS mEANT to be a typical Sunday. Just like every
Sunday, my mother and I were getting ready to visit my older brother at
his Waikiki apartment, where we would talk for a little while. But July
22nd was different. That chilly morning, we got a phone call from his
roommate telling us my brother was going to the emergency room. As
we drove to Queen’s Hospital, I didn’t know what to think. Although
I tried to assure myself that nothing serious could have happened to
him, anxiety clouded my mind.
My brother, Tyson, emigrated from vietnam with my mom and my
other older brother to the United States in 1990, with dreams of a new
life and fresh opportunities. He enrolled in high school with virtually
no knowledge of the English language. Even though he had to simultaneously
manage a part-time job at McDonald’s, he excelled in academics
and was the top of his class in calculus.
At 34 years old, he was the epitome of health: he ran marathons every
year, had a healthy diet, and never smoked or drank alcohol. When
I got to the Er and saw him lying in the hospital bed, he looked like
the Tyson that I always knew. nothing seemed wrong. He just seemed
tired, and he didn’t have the energy to speak.
However, coming back from an MrI scan, my brother seemed different.
His eyes were unfocused and dazed, as if he didn’t see the room
in front of him. Uneasiness and fear rushed down my spine. I shouted
for help, just as my brother’s body started to spasm. I felt a profound
emotion surging up in me, one that I had never experienced before--a
wrenching sense of trepidation, laced with sickening adrenaline. The
seizure took control of his body, and he began to foam at the mouth.
His body seized up, but I was frozen still. I didn’t know what to do. I
felt useless and terrified.
Tyson told me, when I was just a kid, not to work while I was in
high school. I was young, though, and still wanted to work because I
wanted to make money, like him. During his high school years, he took
on a part-time job after school, even though it meant he had to come
home late every night. Often, he would stay up through the early hours
of the morning, determined to complete his schoolwork. He held down 
the job, despite its exhausting physical toll, because he had to: he had
to assist with the bills and support my mom, so that she could take
English classes at the local community college. Tyson said that I didn’t
have to work, because he would always be there to support me.
While my brother was in the hospital, my mother and I went there
every day from before dawn to late at night, when the streets were empty.
Tyson had developed severe brain inflammation as a result of the
seizure. He had dozens of tests done: X-rays, MrIs, blood tests, spinal
taps, a bronchoscopy, and even a brain biopsy. A labyrinth of Iv tubes,
wires, and cables were hooked up to his body, monitoring his life signs
and feeding dozens of chemicals and solutions into his bloodstream.
The doctors kept him constantly sedated. His brain inflammation was
life-threatening, and he caught a case of severe pneumonia. His doctors
had to place him on life support. In three weeks, my brother had
gone from being in the best shape of his life, from being a veritable
Superman, to laying on his deathbed.
When I was a kid, I was a crybaby. I cried when I didn’t get the toy
I wanted. I cried when I didn’t get the food I wanted. However, at some
point during my childhood, around the age of six, I stopped crying.
no matter how much I was teased or pushed around, I never cried. no
matter how much I was mocked about my clothes, or my ethnicity, I
didn’t cry.
August 11 last year was the first time since childhood that I cried.
It was the day that my brother passed away. And it was the first time
that I ever saw my mom cry. It was a traumatizing experience, and for
a while I was depressed that such a tragedy could occur so arbitrarily
to someone like my brother: someone who was strong, someone who
was healthy, someone who lived by a strong moral code and never sacrificed
his values for material rewards. But after a while, I realized that
the circumstances of his death were not a refutation of his beliefs, but
instead, a reminder of their importance. Even though we cannot control
the twists and turns of life, we must deal with them as best we can.
My brother, even though he didn’t know English, enrolled in school
and ultimately excelled. And at the same time, to help our mother go to
school on the side, he took on a part-time job. Certainly he must have
wished that he hadn’t faced those disadvantages, but he didn’t complain.
rather, he faced the realities of his situation head-on, and succeeded.
Tyson’s death was a tragic reflection of the cold, random chance 
of nature, but it was in no way any verdict on his philosophy: instead,
I realized, it served as a clear reminder to me that the worst can happen
to even the best, and that the strength of an individual lies in his
ability to maintain his values when faced with such difficult situations.
Today, I still hold onto the lessons that my brother taught me through
his actions: to put the needs of your family first, to always persevere
in the face of adversity, and to never compromise your ideals for petty
desires. To lose heart in these values because of his death, then, would
be a harsh disservice to Tyson’s legacy.EVErY TImE I drIVE INTo A client’s driveway, there’s always that moment.
That moment where I must shed any doubt I have and become
adamant. That moment where I realize that, people are depending on
me, and I must do my best to help them. And that moment where, with
tool bag to my side, I must prepare to face whatever problem is waiting
for me in their house. This time is no different. As with the hundreds
of other problems I’ve faced, I must remember that every problem has
a solution, and I can find it.
When I am greeted by a middle-aged woman as I approach the
house, my remaining doubts evaporate. Once I see the individual I am
about to help I become saturated with resolve. However, all she will see
from me is a smile as I ask her how she is. I then ask her what the problem
is, and she leads me to her computer. She tells me that her computer
is shutting down randomly, and then leaves as I begin to work.
With a simple push of the power button, the process begins.
Unfortunately, for this case, just as quickly as it starts—the computer 
shuts off. never discouraged, I dismantle it to look for obvious signs
of damage. However, everything here appears normal: wires secure,
circuits shining.
But there’s another test that may work. Eyes focused on the inside
of the computer, I turn it on again. I have only a moment before it succumbs
to its ailment again. Additionally, each time it starts could be
damaging, so I have to make this count. When the sound of electricity
surging through the computer begins, I immediately notice a vital fan
failing to twirl: the computer is simply overheating. With a quick pull
of the power I anesthetize the computer and operate. Using a replacement
and screwdriver from my bag, I give the computer a new fan.
Then, I start the computer nervously, but it starts perfectly.
My confidence and determination sweat off as accomplishment. I
quickly look for the woman. She can tell I solved her problem as I walk
towards her with a grin, and she smiles too.
This case is one of the hundreds I’ve solved over the past few years,
all without a single failure to find a practical solution. I started my
business because after seeing how grossly overcharged the community
was by corporate technicians, I believed it would be a practical and
great way for me to help the community and have a job. After fixing
computers for my school for a year, school officials quickly noticed and
spread word of my work, allowing my business to spread like wildfire
throughout the local communities. With determination (and some creativity)
I’ve solved some very unordinary and strange problems. I’d like
to use this same willpower to help people in even better ways. no matter
how impossible the problems I encounter may seem I will always
remember what I tell myself when I fix computers: every problem must
have a solution, and I can find it.pArT oF mE IS mISSING. IT’S an identifiable, yet indescribable absence.
It is odd how I can find more information about the initial supposed
creators, Adam and Eve, than I can about my own. I don’t know
my father, and I doubt that I ever will. He left two weeks after I was
born because I lacked a certain male member. Fidelity to personal convictions
was more important to him than a life that he had just shepherded
into this world. Because of his definitive choice, I will only be
able to associate with him as a support check number until I am eighteen
years of age. After that, who knows?
When I was eleven, my mother decided to call this long-gone man
in search of owed child support. After eleven years of nothingness,
financial distress caused my mother call this absolute last resource. In
my house, we had an early 90s telephone that had a speaker/mute
function. I can still see that outdated piece of technology in the corner
of my mind. That speaker/mute function granted me the only contact
with my father that I have ever known.
I was a mischievous child; I knew that day that my mother was
physically on the phone with my birthfather. I was naïve. I thought
that hearing my father’s voice would fill the void created by years of
absence. I thought that hearing his voice would allow me to place my
father on the same grand plateau as other fathers who had always been
there for their children, loved their children. I snuck into the room
with the technical phone and silently listened in on the conversation. I
felt smart and sly as I pressed the button that put the stranger’s voice on
the speakerphone. “Hah,” I thought, “he can’t hear me, but I can hear
him.” Maybe if he would have known the simple fact that his daughter
was listening, maybe then some shred of human decency would have
shined through.
Those few moments provided me with the only ounce of a man that
comprises half of my biology that I will ever know. Unfortunately, the
stranger didn’t know I was listening. Like my life before, he never knew
that I was there. As he yelled at my mother, I could hear the fear in her
voice as he responded to her pleas with such malice. My mother tried
to convey to my father that I was not just his incarnation to be provided
for, but rather, a spectacular human being. As I sat there, listening intently
to the conversation, I felt validated as a daughter by my mother’s
words, but shattered as a human being by my “father’s” insolence.
In the moments that followed, that little girl, initially so excited
at the prospect of finally being able to physically hear her creator,
was eternally crushed. “Just because she exists doesn’t mean I have
to love her; it doesn’t mean I have to know her. I don’t love her, and
I never will.” Crash. Is it possible for the strongest muscle in your
body to simply break in half? One of my genetic halves had declared
that he loathed my very existence. Those words succeeded to shatter
my heart into a million pieces. I didn’t know how to react. I turned
off the phone and slithered back to my room. How could someone
be so heartless? How could someone that heartless be a part of me?
no words.
I have been sobered by pain in a way that no psychological study
ever could attempt. I may never know my father because of his decision,
and in turn, he will never know me. In the end, his loss will be
the greater one. My “father’s” shining example of misconduct ironically
guides me as a moral, ethical person. rather than searching for any
fault within myself, I use my father’s failure as a tool. I take an earnest 
and honest stance in life. I know my great worth. I have nothing to
prove to anyone, including myself.mY FAmILY hAS TAKEN LIVING IN the big city as a reason for why
we should never give up. Here in Los Angeles there are countless individuals
and families along all points on the immigration spectrum from
recent arrivals to recent citizenship. residing in this great city has provided
me with diversity, opportunity, acceptance, and an abundance of
role models to follow through all troubles- big and small.
I always thought that I had it the worst out of all my family members
because I was never allowed to get anything lower than what my
brother or a cousin had gotten in a class. My parents figured if they
could do it, so could I, and if not on my own then with a little of their
help. It was not until recently that I realized the truth in this. In my
short life I have seen my father go from speaking no English, to excelling
in it. I have heard countless stories about migrant farmers such as
Cesar Chavez and my grandfather who had nearly nothing, yet persisted
and succeeded.
growing up hearing these stories of great injustices and misfortunes
has truly influenced my long term goals. I am going to go far because
there is no excuse for not doing my best, given all I have been blessed 
with. When I had trouble speaking Spanish and felt like abandoning
my native tongue I remembered my mother and how when she came
to the United States she was forced to wash her mouth out with soap
and endure beatings with a ruler by the nuns at her school for speaking
it. When I couldn’t figure out tangents, sines, and cosines I thought
about my father and how it took him nearly a year to learn long division
because he was forced to teach it to himself after dropping out and
starting to work in the 4th grade. And when I wanted to quit swimming
because I was tired I remembered my grandfather and how no matter
how his muscles ached if he stopped digging, or picking fruit, or
plowing he risked not having enough food to feed his family. Pursuing
technical fields such as math and engineering first seemed like work for
men to me, but the times have changed. All these people, just from my
family have been strong role models for me.
I feel that being labeled “underprivileged” does not mean that I am
limited in what I can do. There is no reason for me to fail or give up,
and like my parents and grandparents have done, I’ve been able to pull
through a great deal. My environment has made me determined, hard
working, and high aiming. I would not like it any other way. This is
how my Hispanic heritage, family upbringing, and role models have
influenced my academic and personal long term goals.I wISh I wAS INVISIBLE. I wish I was invisible. I wish I was invisible.
One of my biggest fears has always been going to an unfamiliar place,
but each time I have had the satisfaction of knowing that at the end of
the day I can go home. I am a shy person, and it has always been difficult
for me to adjust to a new environment. Transitioning from eighth
grade to high school was especially difficult for me because my high
school was, in fact, a boarding school, which meant that that feeling of
satisfaction was no longer present at the end of the day but postponed
to the end of the week. Living at LFA was a completely new world for
me and nothing I had experienced could have prepared me for it.
With confused eyes and nothing less than a nauseous sensation in
my stomach I entered my first day of high school. growing up, I had always
gone to school with people who looked like me, sounded like me,
and dressed liked me, but here I quickly learned that I was the minority.
I was not alone in this. Two of my friends came to LFA with me and,
with this in mind, my shyness and I did not think it necessary to make
new friends. Besides being one of the only schools with its own ice rink
and providing only the latest technology for its students, it suddenly
hit me that my new home had countless possibilities, but, before those
possibilities could be realized, I had to take initiative. I learned a very
important lesson at LFA: you will only get out of life as much as you
put into it. Stepping out of my comfort zone allowed me to discover an
interest and skill for volleyball and hidden leadership as the captain of
the Jv team. I became a tutor and friend for young Hispanic students 
at the nuestro Center, and they reminded me how important it is to
give back to the community. After numerous all nighters, I developed
a system where I could get all of my homework done and still be able
to get involved with sports and extracurriculars without having to sacrifice
any sleep time.
Towards the end of my sophomore year a family member’s sickness
unfortunately forced me to leave my school and return home. I left LFA
and joined my new family, Mirta ramirez Computer Science Charter
High School. Containing a student body that was 99 percent Hispanic,
I was no longer the minority. I had unconsciously become accustomed
to the LFA way of life because, in my mind, this tiny mustard yellow
building with no more than four windows could not possibly compare
to my old home. I was right. no, my new home was not as big nor as
fancy, but I discovered that was not a setback. Although the resources
were not directly visible nor as easily accessible, I learned that obstacles
did not exist for students there. Most, if not all, of the students had the
same hunger for knowledge as I had.
This summer my school announced that the building which we had
been using had fire code violations and we could not return to our
building in the fall. Throughout the summer my school did not have
a building and did not find one until a few weeks after school started.
By that time I had already taken a decision to, once again, leave my
home and join yet another family. What I realized on my first day at
Josephinum Academy, was that my shyness had not tagged along and
I was eager to go to school. The nauseous feeling had left my stomach
and enthusiasm had entered. I had already gained and learned so much
from the people I had met in my two previous schools that I could not
wait to continue my journey and embark on yet another discovery.
The knowledge that I have gained from these three schools is something
I will take with me far beyond college. My roommate, across-thehall
mates, and classmates have influenced my life as much as I hope
to have impacted theirs. It is evident to me that they have helped me
develop into the very much visible person I am today. I have learned to
step outside of my comfort zone, and I have learned that diversity is so
much more than the tint of our skin. My small mustard colored school
taught me that opportunity and success only requires desire.
I would be an asset to your college because as I continue on my
journey to success, I will take advantage of every opportunity that is 
available to me and make sure to contribute as much as I can too.
now I am visible. now I am visible. now I am visible, and I want to
be seen.GrowING Up wITh SEpArATEd pArENTS hAS not been the easiest
life, but it has been my life. When I was younger, I’d hate going out to
eat with my dad and seeing a family of four happily enjoying a meal.
If my mother and father ever went out together to a restaurant, it was
with me, once a year for my birthday, and was usually interspersed
with various disagreements.
It was when I was in first grade that I began to realize that, although
my parents had their differences and no longer loved each other, I was
the one thing that united them. I had no basis to be envious of what I
thought of as “complete” families.
Both my mother and father, wanting the best for me, recognized
early on my love and fascination with all things scientific. They worked
to create opportunities for me to pursue my interest. My mother would
read at bedtime, at my request, nature field guides instead of nursery
rhymes. The two of us often made long journeys at 3:00 A.M. to witness
meteor showers in the clear skies of the mountains. She encouraged me
to set up experiments around the house, which I happily did—measuring
the growth of palm tree saplings and dissecting owl pellets to
extract the mouse bones inside. An environmental scientist, my father
could not wait to transfer all of his scientific knowledge into my young
head. needless to say, many of his spontaneous lectures were far above
my grasp—I still vaguely remember a quantum physics talk he gave me
when I was eight—but they inspired me to learn more on my own.
My thirst for scientific knowledge grew over the years, without
limits in any one specific area. Then, in January four years ago, my 
Aunt Diane died after a five-year battle with breast cancer. It was during
my aunt’s illness that I realized I could use my natural love of science to
benefit others facing similar challenges.
I have continually pushed myself closer to this goal by excelling in
my AP science classes, studying biotechnology at UC Davis through the
COSMOS program, and competing as a member of my school’s Science
Bowl Team. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at the
reijo Pera Lab at Stanford University through the Stanford Institutes of
Medicine Summer research Program. During this two-month internship,
I worked with human embryonic stem cells to explore the function
of PrDM1, a potentially-useful gene in the creation of regenerative
medicines.
The scientific spark my parents recognized years ago has shaped my
life, and with it, I wish to shape the lives of others. I aspire to become a
biomedical researcher, a career that harnesses my long-time fascination
of science and my commitment to improve the quality of life for those
facing medical challenges. It would be a privilege to work alongside
scientists, exploring new treatments and technologies to create exciting
new options for patients and their families.
